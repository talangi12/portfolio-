# SOLUTION APPROACH

This project aims to create a static web page based on the visual layout provided in the series of images. The solution involves structuring the content using HTML and styling it with CSS to replicate the look and feel of the original website

# HTML Structure:

The HTML (web.html) is organized semantically using appropriate tags like <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, etc.
The content is divided into logical sections mirroring the different parts of the visual layout (hero section, biography, services, skills, portfolio, contact, footer).
Basic text content is included within the HTML structure to represent the information displayed in the images.
Font Awesome library is linked via CDN to provide icons used throughout the website.
A simple JavaScript snippet is included at the end of the <body> to animate the progress bars in the "My Skills" section based on the data-percent attribute.
A basic sidebar structure is included as seen in the initial image.



# CSS Styling:

The CSS (style.css) is responsible for the visual presentation of the HTML content.
A reset or basic styling is applied to the body for consistent rendering across browsers.
The layout is achieved using a combination of Flexbox and CSS Grid for different sections to handle responsiveness and alignment.
Specific styles are defined for each section (header, hero, biography, services, skills, etc.) to match the fonts, colors, spacing, and overall appearance of the reference website.
Responsive design is implemented using media queries to ensure the website adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile). The layout adjusts to a single-column layout on smaller screens for better readability.
Styles for buttons, navigation, text elements, images, and icons are included to closely resemble the visual design.
The background image for the hero section is implemented using the background-image property in CSS.
The logo in the header and footer is implemented using an <img> tag, with basic CSS to control its size and alignment.
The sidebar is styled with fixed positioning to appear as in the initial image.
